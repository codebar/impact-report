      <p class="bigger-text">codebar is a global community empowering minorities to break into tech.</p>

      <p class="big-text">Since 2013, codebar has created opportunities for minority group members to pursue a career in tech. Over a span of 10 years, we have held more than 2,000 workshops and created a global community of over 25,000 students and coaches. </p>
    </article>

    <p class="big-text drop-cap two-thirds">In this impact report, we assess how our initiatives have made careers in tech more accessible for minorities from all over the world. </p>

    <p class="big-text two-thirds">This is achieved through findings captured in a community-wide survey, which will drive improvements in future initiatives that further our cause.</p>


    <h2>Our work is an answer to the diversity problem in tech.</h2>

    <p class="big-text drop-cap two-thirds">Ethnic minorities make up only 15.2% of the tech labour market in the UK, while women are just slightly above that at 25.5%<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>. Diversity is still a major issue in the tech industry despite being one of the world’s fastest growing fields. </p>

    <img src="assets/percentages.png" alt="15.2% person, and 25.5% person graphic" class="pull-right" />

    <p class="big-text two-thirds">Through our initiatives, we provide education, training and networking opportunities for members of underrepresented groups in tech. We believe in the strength that diversity brings and the importance of diverse thinking in an industry where innovation is a constant.</p>


    <h2>Our global community</h2>

    <p class="bigger-text"><strong>18,385</strong> students and <strong>6,512</strong> coaches in 33 chapters worldwide</p>

    <p class="big-text two-thirds drop-cap">codebar has something for every community member to grow within a setting that suits them best. Over the years, our initiatives have grown from offering regular free workshops, to organising festivals, job fairs, and hosting community-run events.</p>

    <p class="big-text two-thirds">When the world went into lockdown during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, we shifted our initiatives online. The opportunity to learn from seasoned professionals from anywhere in the world was embraced by our community wholeheartedly, so much so that we have decided to move towards a hybrid way of running workshops and events - giving our community even more options to take them closer to their goals.</p>

    <ul class="box-list box-list--neon">
      <li>54% of our community did not work in tech before codebar</li>

These workshops take place within numerous chapters all over the world and are led by developers who choose to volunteer as coaches with us.</p>

    <p class="big-text two-thirds">Through our workshops, we have created vibrant, collaborative environments for minorities to learn HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Python and Git.

      uncodebar cultivates authentic spaces for genuine conversations and growth.
    </p>

    <p class="big-text two-thirds">Now in its 9th year, uncodebar is an annual event that is 100% participant-led. It is our version of an unconference, which can be defined as a "loosely structured open space event emphasising the informal exchange of information and ideas between participants".</p>

    <p class="big-text two-thirds">During uncodebar, community members propose talks, panels, workshops and decide which topics they’d like to focus on for the day before convening in separate breakout sessions. These topics include anything related to web development, software development, game development, learning, mentoring and community. Anyone is welcome to participate - whether you’re a seasoned developer or a first-time speaker.</p>

    <p class="big-text two-thirds">uncodebar is a testament to the proactive and dedicated spirit of codebar. Everything lies in the hands of our community, and through their involvement, we grow and thrive as one. In 2023 we were so excited to bring this special event to more locations - Glasgow and Barcelona.</p>

    <h2>Thoughts from our community</h2>
    <h3>Coaches</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/1.svg" alt="female graphic" /><q>codebar is a genuine community and genuine people who aren't in it for anything else other than to drive change.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/2.svg" alt="female graphic" /><q>It's amazing to have a platform that connects students and coaches. My interaction with the students has demonstrated that there are lots of technical talent out there, who comes from non-tech backgrounds and this platforms gives those students an opportunity to move into tech.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/3.svg" alt="male graphic" /><q>From a coaching perspective, codebar has helped me feel more confident in my skills when I help someone else solve a problem. I also love seeing how people who are new to tech are so interested and excited about its capabilities and it's very infectious!</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/4.svg" alt="male graphic" /><q>codebar puts together learners and real developers. I initially came to codebar as a student and I was stuck in tutorial hell. Having someone IRL explain things to me made learning so much easier.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/5.svg" alt="person graphic" /><q>To me, codebar feels like a safe space to help people learn to code for the first time. It opens up networks between coaches and students which can build professional relationships outside of the codebar community to open up career opportunities.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Students</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/6.svg" alt="female graphic" />
      <q>I met role models. I saw that developers are socially engaged and willing to help others, instead of the 'autistic hacker' idea that many people have. I met people from companies, telling me I can do what they do. I am quite a bit older than most and still the encouragement was there: Go for it.
      </q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/7.svg" alt="person graphic" />
      <q>It's great that codebar continues to provide an open opportunity for people to try some tech and see what it's like. The more diverse the people within the industry the better the software is generated which can only help
        the industry.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/8.svg" alt="person graphic" />
      <q>I feel like I now have a place to go with my questions and a community that I can be part of where i see myself being represented. This is the first time that i've found this and i'm so excited to continue being a member.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/9.svg" alt="person graphic" />
      <q>I found the teaching and space to be inclusive and gentle which is exactly what I needed to start learning.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/10.svg" alt="person graphic" />
      <q>Codebar coaches are extremely dedicated, respectful, friendly and experienced individuals who really encourage students and are willing to give up their time to give advice and support that makes a massive difference to students.</q>
    </blockquote>


    <h3>Career switchers</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/11.svg" alt="person graphic" />
      <q>I have gone from being a student (having been encouraged by people at work to go), to organising my local chapter and now coding full time for my job. codebar had a huge role in that, making me feel there was a place in the tech community for me and increasing my confidence that I could be a developer.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/12.svg" alt="person graphic" />
      <q>Before codebar I was an Elementary School teacher. I attended out of curiosity and it led me to find a more complete course in coding and eventually found a job in the industry.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/13.svg" alt="person graphic" />
      <q>codebar gave me an initial boost learning python. I attended something like 10-15 workshops where I received excellent instruction from the coaches. This gave me the skills and confidence to work on my own projects, and I eventually got a job in tech about a year later.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/14.svg" alt="person graphic" />
      <q>I managed to gain confidence to complete most of my university tasks and apply for tech roles. Got help with
        interview readiness which has helped me land an internship with Marsh as a Cyber Security Analyst.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/15.svg" alt="person graphic" />
      <q>I found my current job through Codebar festival. I've met a wide range of incredibly knowledgeable and empathic mentors who have helped me with all aspects of my career development. It has made me feel more like I belong in tech and that my presence is valuable there.</q>
