      <p class="bigger-text">Codebar is a global community
        empowering minorities to break into tech.
      </p>

      <p class="big-text">Since 2013, codebar has created opportunities for minority group members to pursue a career in
        tech. Over a
        span of 10 years, we have held more than 1,700 workshops and created a global community of over 19,000
        students
        and coaches. </p>
    </article>

    <p class="big-text drop-cap two-thirds">In this impact report, we assess how our initiatives have made careers in
      tech more
      accessible for
      minorities from
      all over the world. </p>

    <p class="big-text two-thirds">This is achieved through findings captured in a community-wide survey, which will
      drive
      improvements in future
      initiatives that further our cause.</p>


    <h2>Our work is an answer to the
      diversity problem in tech.
    </h2>

    <p class="big-text drop-cap two-thirds">Ethnic minorities make up only 15.2% of the tech labour market in the UK,
      while women
      are
      just
      slightly above
      that
      at 25.5%<sup><a href="#footnote-1">1</a></sup>. Diversity is still a major issue in the tech industry despite
      being
      one of the world’s fastest
      growing
      fields. </p>

    <img src="assets/percentages.png" alt="" class="pull-right" />

    <p class="big-text two-thirds">Through our initiatives, we provide education, training and networking opportunities
      for members
      of
      underrepresented groups in tech. We believe in the strength that diversity brings and the importance of diverse
      thinking in an industry where innovation is a constant.</p>


    <h2>Our global community
    </h2>

    <p class="bigger-text two-thirds"><strong>14,048</strong> students and <strong>5,183</strong> coaches in over 30
      chapters
