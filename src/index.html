      <p>codebar is a global community

      <p>Since 2013, codebar has created opportunities for minority group members to pursue a career in tech. Over a
        span of 10 years, we have held more than 1,700 workshops and created a global community of over 19,000 students

  <p class="big-text">In this impact report, we assess how our initiatives have made careers in tech more accessible for
    minorities from
    all over the world. </p>

  <p class="big-text">This is achieved through findings captured in a community-wide survey, which will drive
    improvements in future
    initiatives that further our cause.</p>


  <h2>Our work is an answer to the
    diversity problem in tech.
  </h2>

  <p class="big-text">Ethnic minorities make up only 15.2% of the tech labour market in the UK, while women are just
    slightly above
    that
    at 25.5%<sup>1</sup>. Diversity is still a major issue in the tech industry despite being one of the world’s fastest
    growing
    fields. </p>

  <img src="assets/percentages.png" alt="" class="pull-right" />

  <p class="big-text">Through our initiatives, we provide education, training and networking opportunities for members
    of
    underrepresented groups in tech. We believe in the strength that diversity brings and the importance of diverse
    thinking in an industry where innovation is a constant.</p>
