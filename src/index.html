      <h3 class="">We are dedicated to changing the face of tech.</h3>

      <p class="big-text">codebar is a global community-based charity that champions diversity in the tech industry.</p>

      <p class="big-text">Since 2013, codebar has created tens of thousands of opportunities for minority group members to pursue a career in tech. Over the span of 12 years, we have held more than 2,700¹ workshops and events, and created a global community of over 27,500¹ students and coaches.</p>

    <ul class="faded-stat-box">

      <p class="tiny-text margin-top-double">codebar stats as of 6th of January 2026 - <a href="https://stats.codebar.io/" target="_blank" class="white-link">stats.codebar.io</a></p>
    </article>

    <h3>In this impact report, we tell you more about the codebar community and assess how our initiatives have made careers in tech more accessible for minorities from all over the world.</h3>

    <p class="medium-text">Despite the challenges this year brought, we remained committed to our mission by adapting and innovating to continue supporting our community as much as possible. These efforts are reflected in the findings captured through a community-wide survey. This feedback will drive improvements in future initiatives, ensuring we can further our cause and make an even greater impact!</p>


    <h2 class="pink-font">Our work is the answer to the diversity problem in tech.</h2>

    <p class="medium-text drop-cap two-thirds">Diversity is still a major issue in the tech industry, despite being one of the world’s fastest growing fields. Women represent 52% of the UK population, but only 20% of software engineers. This disparity is even more stark for Black people, who make up just 5% of the tech sector.</p>

    <img src="assets/percentages-v2.png" alt="5% person, and 20% person graphic" class="pull-right" />

    <p class="medium-text two-thirds">Through our initiatives, we provide education, training, mentorship and networking opportunities for members of under-represented groups in tech. We believe in the strength that diversity brings and the importance of diverse thinking in an industry where innovation is a constant.</p>

    <h2>Case studies</h2>

    <p class="medium-text drop-cap">codebar has something for every community member to grow within a setting that suits them best. Over the years, our initiatives have grown from offering regular free workshops to organising festivals, job fairs, and hosting community-run events. We run virtual and in-person events to reach as many people as possible. From this, our attendees say:</p>

    <p class="medium-text"><i>“The community is fantastic. I really enjoy hearing about people’s journeys. [There are] so many different paths people are walking on! And people are generally amazingly helpful. I love being part of codebar and going to events. I feel I belong. I feel I have my community.”</i></p>
    
    <p class="medium-text"><i>“The codebar community is incredibly supportive and ensures that anyone learning programming or improving their programming skills is very welcome. If it wasn’t for the codebar community, I doubt I would still be working in tech.”</i></p>

    <ul class="box-list box-list--neon">
      <li>73% of our community did not work in tech before codebar</li>
      <li>51% of people who attended an event said the skills they learnt helped them find a job in the industry</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <div class="contained">
    <h3 class="bigger-text pink-font">Workshops</h3>

    <p class="medium-text drop-cap">It all started with our workshops. To make tech careers more accessible, we began running regular free programming workshops in October 2013. These workshops take place all over the world and are led by developers who choose to volunteer as coaches with us.</p>

    <p class="medium-text">Through our workshops, we have created vibrant, collaborative environments for minorities to learn HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Ruby, Python, and Git. Companies partner with us to host these workshops at their space, therefore helping aspiring developers expand their industry exposure early in their careers.</p>
    
    <p class="medium-text">Our attendees are able to learn and thrive in these workshops, with one community member stating: <i>“Each time I would come out of a workshop feeling energised, and that would help me keep focused on my journey and not give up.”</i></p>

    <ul class="box-list">
      <li class="pink-bg">Our workshops connect minorities to dedicated coaches who want to see them succeed</li>
      <li class="pink-bg">2,500 workshops and counting</li>

Attendees have the opportunity to participate in talks, panels, and hands-on technical workshops, as well as network with industry professionals. We have received amazing feedback from attendees, with one highlighting the networking benefits of the event: <i>“I made a great friend with a speaker I connected with at the last codebar Festival! Our connection thereafter has helped embolden my thinking on a couple of subjects and has influenced me to steer the next steps of my career in a certain direction.”</i></p>

    <p class="medium-text">After five successful years of running codebar Festival, we are excited to see its return for a sixth year in 2026.</p>

    <h2>uncodebar</h2>

    <p class="bigger-text">uncodebar cultivates authentic spaces for genuine conversations and growth.</p>

    <p class="medium-text">Now in its 11th year, uncodebar is an annual event that is 100% participant-led. It is our version of an unconference, which can be defined as a "loosely structured open space event emphasising the informal exchange of information and ideas between participants."</p>

    <p class="medium-text">During uncodebar, community members propose talks, panels, workshops, and decide which topics they’d like to focus on for the day before convening in separate breakout sessions. These topics include anything related to web development, software development, game development, learning, mentoring, and community. Anyone is welcome to participate, whether you’re a seasoned developer or a first-time speaker.</p>

    <p class="medium-text">uncodebar is a testament to the proactive and dedicated spirit of codebar. Everything lies in the hands of our community and, through their involvement, we grow and thrive as one.</p>

    <h3>Thoughts from our community: Coaches</h3>

    <p class="bigger-text">50% of coaches say they volunteer to drive positive change in the industry</p>

    <blockquote class="margin-top-double">
      <img src="assets/thoughts/1.svg" alt="female graphic" /><q>codebar is a genuine community and genuine people who aren't in it for anything else other than to drive change.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/2.svg" alt="female graphic" /><q>It's amazing to have a community that connects students and coaches. My interaction with the students has demonstrated that there are lots of technical talent out there, [which] comes from non-tech backgrounds, and this platforms gives those students an opportunity to move into tech.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/3.svg" alt="male graphic" /><q>From a coaching perspective, codebar has helped me feel more confident in my skills when I help someone else solve a problem. I also love seeing how people who are new to tech are so interested and excited about its capabilities and it's very infectious!</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/4.svg" alt="male graphic" /><q>codebar puts together learners and real developers. I initially came to codebar as a student and I was stuck in tutorial hell. Having someone IRL explain things to me made learning so much easier.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/5.svg" alt="person graphic" /><q>To me, codebar is a safe space to help people learn to code for the first time. It opens up networks between coaches and students which can build professional relationships outside of the codebar community to open up career opportunities.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Thoughts from our community: Students</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/6.svg" alt="female graphic" />
      <q>codebar has allowed me to feel more empowered by shedding the self-doubt and imposter syndrome. The fact that people from codebar really seem to want to connect to the everyday person that has a genuine interest in learning, addressing very common issues and also complex ones [has really helped me].</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/7.svg" alt="person graphic" />
      <q>It has made me feel like I'm not limited in my career and that I have not only the ability but the option to learn something new and to put it to good use. It is very empowering knowing that I am becoming more skilled.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/8.svg" alt="person graphic" />
      <q>I found the teaching and space to be inclusive and gentle, which is exactly what I needed to start learning.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/9.svg" alt="person graphic" />
      <q>codebar coaches are extremely dedicated, respectful, friendly, and experienced individuals who really encourage students and are willing to give up their time to give advice and support, which makes a massive difference to students.</q>
    </blockquote>


    <h3>Thoughts from our community: Career switchers</h3>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/10.svg" alt="person graphic" />
      <q>I found my current job through codebar Festival. I've met a wide range of incredibly knowledgeable and empathetic mentors who have helped me with all aspects of my career development. It has made me feel more like I belong in tech and that my presence is valuable there.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/11.svg" alt="person graphic" />
      <q>I managed to gain confidence to complete most of my university tasks and apply for tech roles. I got help with interview readiness, which has helped me land an internship with Marsh as a Cyber Security Analyst.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/12.svg" alt="person graphic" />
      <q>Before codebar, I was an Elementary School teacher. I attended out of curiosity and it led me to find a more complete course in coding and eventually I found a job in the industry.</q>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
      <img src="assets/thoughts/13.svg" alt="person graphic" />
      <q>I'm happy to have participated in the  30 Days of Python challenge! <br />During the month-long program, I found that I enjoyed predictive analytics when I used them to identify trends in healthcare and I'm excited to dive further into this area of the field!<br />A huge thank you codebar for hosting this free 30-day workshop; and Charlene Kuye for being a fantastic leader, being patient, and answering questions; and the rest of our cohort for participating!</q>

    <h2>What's next for codebar?</h2>

    <p class="medium-text drop-cap">We’ve had an amazing 12 years, and we’re excited to continue creating opportunities for people from underrepresented backgrounds to break into tech in 2026. codebar has already made a significant impact on the industry, supporting thousands of people into tech roles and building a truly inclusive, supportive community. However, there is still much more to do to address the sector’s ongoing diversity challenges. As a charity that puts its community first, we will continue working closely with our members to evolve and strengthen our offering.</p>

    <img src="assets/superhero.svg" alt="superhero graphic" class="pull-right" />

    <p class="medium-text two-thirds">In 2026, a big focus will be introducing more structured learning opportunities. We recognise the power of learning alongside peers to build confidence, consistency, and a stronger sense of belonging.</p>

    <p class="medium-text two-thirds">Alongside this, we will carefully review feedback from our community-wide survey, ensuring our future programmes reflect what our members need most and how we can best support them at every stage of their journey.</p>

    <p class="medium-text">We'll be running codebar Festival again in 2026, as well as expanding the locations where codebar runs workshops.</p>

    <p class="medium-text centred-text">We also want to give a big thank you to all the companies who have supported us over the last 12 years.
